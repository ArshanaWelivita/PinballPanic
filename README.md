Description of Pinball Panic Game:

The arrow ( -> ) indicates starting position and trajectory.
The bumpers ( ╲ and ╱ ) deflect the ball at a 90 degree angle.

'-> [ ] [╲] [ ] [ ]'

  '[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]'
  
  '[ ] [╲] [ ] [╱]'
  
  '[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]'

After 3 seconds, the bumpers in the grid will disappear. And the user will be prompted to enter the ball's ending location.

   'a   b   c   d'
   
'A [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] AA'

'B [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] BB'

'C [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] CC'

'D [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] DD'

 'aa  bb  cc  dd'

In this case, the answer is "d".
